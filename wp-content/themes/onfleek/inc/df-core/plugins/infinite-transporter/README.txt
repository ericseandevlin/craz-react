Infinite scroll extended to single post pages

== Description ==

In addition to normal infinite scroll behavior, this plugin adds infinite scroll to the single post page. When reading a single post, once the reader reaches the bottom of the page, the next post loads in. This is similar to functionality on big news sites such as Time.com, LA Times, Quartz, Vogue.com

The default WordPress TwentySomething themes, Genesis themes and Canvas themes are already compatable with this plugin and ready to go!

Relies on add_theme_support. If your theme is not in the above list, add the folliwing to your themes functions.php file: `add_theme_support( 'infinite-transporter' );`

See installation and FAQ sections for more on getting set up.

The available options are the same as those in Jetpack Infinite Scroll. To configure further, see the following: http://jetpack.me/support/infinite-scroll/

The plugin assumes that your themes content container is named 'content', unless otherwise defined. If posts are loaded in a container named differently than that, for example inside of a div named 'main', then in your 'add_theme_support' declaration, include the 'container' argument with name of your themes container div like so: 

`add_theme_support( 'infinite-transporter', array( 'container' => 'main' ) );`
